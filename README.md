# Gabriel César Rogério

### Hello World 👋

Welcome to the shelf, you can find my stuff here.

I'm a developer, passionate about front-end.

I can help you with Javascript (ES6+), Angular (2, v12+), RxJS, Node, Nest and AWS.

I have experience focusing on code quality, best practices, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. Currently seeking remote opportunities with EU or UK-based companies or sponsorship.

EU citizenship (Italian) in progress.
